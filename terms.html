                                available at the relevant booth of Amusnet Interactive, or by scanning the QR code on

                                tablet provided by the hostesses at Amusnet Interactive's booth.</span></li>
                        <li><span>To participate in the Game, the person should follow the guidelines below:<br>
                                a. The goal of the Game is to find matching pairs of cards with identical symbols from
                                Amusnet Interactive's slot games for the shortest amount of time.<br>
                                b. If the cards match, they will remain face-up. If the cards do not match, they will
                                flip back face-down, and you try again to find another match.<br>
                                c. The person participating in the Game should pay attention to the locations of the
                                cards once flipped over, as this information becomes crucial for making matches based on
                                memory.<br>
                                d. To complete the Game the person must successfully match all the pairs of cards. The
                                time taken to complete the Game will then be displayed.<br>
                                e. After finishing, a Leaderboard will display the participant's ranking. The
                                Leaderboard will include the name and surname of the current Top 10 participants, as
                                well as the exact time they completed the Game that ranked them at the relevant spot on
                                the Leaderboard.<br>
                                f. If a person has secured a spot among the Top 10 players for the day, he/she
                                participates in a draw for a chance to win one of the prizes.<br>
                                g. A person can play the Game multiple times in order to improve his/her ranking or
                                simply visit the Leaderboard to check the current ranking.</span></li>

                <li><span>Determination and announcement of the Raffle winner</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>The determination of a winner will be made by drawing among the Top 10 players in
                                the Game for each day based on the ranking at 16:30 GMT. The draw will take place at
                                17:00 GMT on the 6th and 7th of February 2024. Each drawing for a winning entrant will
                                be conducted automatically through the use of software that randomly selects the winning
                                entrant.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The Top 10 players according to the Leaderboard at 16:30 GMT will receive an

                                booth at 17:00 GMT.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The prizes will be distributed to the winners at the Amusnet Interactive booth
                                right after the winning participant is announced.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Upon receipt of the prize, the winning participant must submit a valid identity
                                document for verification by Amusnet Interactive in order to establish his/her identity.
                                Amusnet Interactive immediately returns the identity document after the verification,
                                and the company does not store the provided identity document on paper or electronic
                                media.</span> </li>
                        <li><span>To certify the delivery of the prize, Amusnet Interactive and the winning
                                participant sign a handover protocol. The winning participant will also receive an email
                                notifying him/her of winning the prize.</span></li>
                        <li><span>In the event that the winning participant:<br>
                                a. does not show up at the Amusnet Interactive booth at 17:00 GMT to receive his/her
                                prize in person,<br>

                                c. refuses to sign a handover protocol for receiving the prize.<br>
                                Then in any of the above cases, Amusnet Interactive may refuse to award the prize to the
                                winning entrant and, accordingly, if it decides, to proceed with awarding the prize to
                                an alternate winner. For the avoidance of doubt, the winning entrant agrees that in the
                                cases referred to in clause 7.5 the winning entrant forfeits the right to receive the
                                prize.</span></li>

                        <li><span>In the event that all of the Top 10 Players have been subsequently drawn at 17:00
                                GMT, but none of them are present at Amusnet Interactive's booth at that time, the prize
                                will be awarded to the first participant that was drawn as a winner. In this case the
                                winning participant will receive an email with further instructions on how he/she can
                                receive the award.</span></li>
