            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <ul>

            <h2>Find matching pairs</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The goal is to find matching pairs of cards with identical AMUSNET slots pictures.</li>
                <li>Remember the pictures on each card as you flip them over. Pay attention to the locations of the
                    cards you've flipped over, as this information becomes crucial for making matches based on your
                    memory.</li>
                <li>If the cards match, they will remain face-up.</li>
                <li>If the cards do not match, they will flip back face-down, and you try again to find another match.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Complete the game</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Continue playing until you have successfully matched all the pairs.</li>
                <li>The game will display the time taken to complete the game.</li>
                <li>After finishing, check the Leaderboard to see your ranking.</li>
